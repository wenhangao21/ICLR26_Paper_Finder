# Semantic Search Across AI Venues

*TL;DR:* A tool that retrieves semantically similar papers from selected AI venues, including over 17,000 ICLR 2026 submissions.

🔗 **[AI Paper Finder Web Interface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/wenhanacademia/)**

**We're still in beta and expanding the list of supported venues! We may update the beta version with new links updated here, so please save and star [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/wenhangao21/ICLR26_Paper_Finder) for future reference before the stable release.**

- There are already some tools avalible, e.g. [Paper Digest](https://www.paperdigest.org/). However,
	- ICLR 2026 submissions are not included yet.
	- Most existing tools rely mainly on keyword-based search, whereas we enable searches using full paper abstracts.
	- Why abstracts? They contain much richer information than titles or keywords.


You can ACTUALLY build your own Paper Finder in less than 30 minutes. See `Tutorial_Making_Paper_Recommenders.ipynb` in the parent directory of this page.

## What We’re Working On

We are currently:

* Expanding the list of supported venues
* Designing improved user interfaces
* Researching advanced paper-matching algorithms
* Developing multi-agent–supported search capabilities
* Enabling batch input and batch output
* Exploring researcher-specific personalization features (researcher persona)

We are PhD students doing AI research, and it’s hard to afford servers to host this tool.

We’re currently seeking affordable server options, contact us if you have any suggestions.
