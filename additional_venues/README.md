üì¢ **Stay tuned** ‚Äî With the extension of venues, we'll release more scripts that collect paper information and process it into the same format used in the tutorial for your convenience. 

üóÇÔ∏è **List of processed venues:**
  - ICML
  - ICLR
  - NeurIPS
  - CVPR
  - ICCV

- For ICML/ICLR/NeurIPS:
```bash
# For example, obtaining all paper information submitted to ICLR 2025
python ICML_ICLR_NeurIPS.py --conf_name ICLR --year 2025 --email <Your Openreview Email> --password <Your Openreview Password> --state Submitted
```

- For CVPR/ICCV:
```bash
# For example, obtaining all paper information submitted to CVPR 2025
python CVPR_ICCV.py --conf_name CVPR --year 2025 
```

Due to lack of APIs, obtaining papers from openreview (ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS) will be much faster than other crawler based methods.
